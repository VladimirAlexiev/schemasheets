# Specifying cardinality

## About

Cardinality refers to how many values a particular field is required or allowed to have

## How it works

See configschema.yaml for all possible vocabularies, these include:

- UML strings, e.g. '0..1'
- text strings matching the cardinality vocabulary, e.g. 'zero to one'
- codes used in cardinality vocabulary, e.g. O, M, ...

The vocabulary maps to underlying LinkML primitives:

- [required](https://w3id.org/linkml/required)
- [multivalued](https://w3id.org/linkml/multivalued)
- [recommended](https://w3id.org/linkml/recommended)

## Cardinality Vocabulary

* [Cardinality vocabulary](../../datamodel/Cardinality/)

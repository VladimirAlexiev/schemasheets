# Simple data dictionaries

This framework allows you to represent complex relation-style schemas
using spreadsheets/TSVs. But it also allows for representation of simple "data dictionaries" or "minimal information lists".
These can be thought of as "wide tables", e.g. representing individual observations or observable units such as persons or samples.
